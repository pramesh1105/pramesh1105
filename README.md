ðŸ”­ I have extensie coding experience in C, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and SQL. Currently, I am working in Software Engineering Manager Role.
- ðŸŒ± Right now my attention turned towards learning Python, data science and machine learning. It's always better to be hands-on with the current trends even for the people in mangerial roles.
- âš¡ Fun facts: I cleared all 3 levels of Chartered Market TechnicianÂ® (CMT) program each level in single attempt but I can not get chartership as I do not work in Finance industry. For professional membership they need 3 years of work experience in finance industry and 3 sponserers. I studied technical analysis out of curiosity during COVID lock down. Knowledge never goes waste, professional member or not does not matter!
